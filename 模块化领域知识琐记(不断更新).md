#Some characterizing attributes of a genuine module are:
An autonomous unit of deployment (loose coupling)
A consistent and unique identity (module ID and version)
Easily identified and discovered requirements and dependencies (standard compile-time and deployment facilities and meta-information)
An open and understandable interface (communication contract)
Hidden implementation details (encapsulation)
